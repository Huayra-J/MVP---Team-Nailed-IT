<h1>Study Skills Acedemic Writing</h1>


<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>In this section, we take you through some of the ways in which you can write using an academic style which is appropriate
   and grammatically correct. We provide you with information on what to expect and how to go about achieving a satisfactory
   academic style, including the use of inclusive language.</p>

   <p>If you come from a background where English is not your first language, it will be helpful to you to look at the section on
  common problems in language construction. If you feel your style is too informal or colloquial, read the section on making your
   language sound formal and what to avoid. There is also a useful guide to using punctuation and for including the ideas from
  research literature in your writing.</p>

  <p>If you would like further information, please contact staff from the Academic Language and Learning Success Program (ALLSP),
  who run free workshops for internal and external students on English language usage as well as developing your skills to edit
  and proofread your assignments.</p>
